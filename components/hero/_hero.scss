Page Hero

Heroes on need to accomplish two main tasks. First, they need to convey a 
specific story as simply and beautifully as they can in order to drive traffic. 
Secondly, they need to set the tone for the page they are setting up.

Very simple type and imagery treatments can create different feels for pages 
that need to stand on their own.
