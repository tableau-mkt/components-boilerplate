/*
Responsive Filters

Given sets of filter options as checkboxes or radio buttons, generate dynamic
mobile equivalents wrapped into a select elements and bind the same filtering
behavior to them. The example below is shown by default, but in practice, the
filters could be hidden by adding specific classes / media query controls, such
as <code>.desktop-hide</code>
