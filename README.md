# Tableau Components

A component library and automated style guide based on the Tableau corporate 
brand. This README focuses on development within the component library to create
new and modify existing components. See the overview page of the generated style
guide (demo below) for usage instructions and guidelines.

### [Production Style Guide](http://tableau-mkt.github.io/styleguide/)
### [QA/Integration Style Guide](http://tableau-mkt.github.io/components/)

## Getting started

Clone this repo (or a fork of it) to your local machine for development. Once
you have a local instance of the repo, install development and front-end 
dependencies and initialize your first grunt build.

```
$ npm install
$ bower install
$ grunt build
``` 

In addition, we use a Grunt task for automatically building an icon font out of
SVG files which has several dependencies needed in order to successfully build 
everything. Install them with one of the following:

#### OS X
```
$ brew install ttfautohint fontforge --with-python
```

#### Linux
```
$ sudo apt-get install fontforge ttfautohint
```

#### Windows
See details [here](https://github.com/sapegin/grunt-webfont#windows).

### Development workflow
This project uses Grunt to run build and setup process such as sass globbing and
building the kss-node style guide. While developing components, run grunt watch 
to have grunt listen to all file changes and run any necessary processes.

```
$ grunt watch
```

#### Running Style Guide Locally

To run the style guide locally, there are several options. The easiest method is
to to utilize grunt-connect to run a simple web server by running the following 
in a separate shell from `grunt watch`:

```
$ grunt connect:styleguide
```

Alternatively, he style guide is just static files that are generated by grunt 
and output in [styleguide/](/styleguide/) so they can be viewed directly from 
the file system or a virtual host can be set up with a local development server
if you run one. With a virtual host, though, make sure to point to the repo's 
root rather than the /styleguide/ directory directly since the style guide also 
needs access to assets within /build/.

#### Live Reload
Grunt watch also provides live reload functionality to refresh your browser tab 
whenever grunt runs a task. To enable this in your workflow, grab the browser 
plugin for your browser of choice such as the [Google Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livereload/jnihajbhpnppcggbcgedagnkighmdlei?hl=en)
and follow the instructions to enable it in your working tab.

#### Final build
Once you are done with work on components and ready tyo commit changes, kill any
running `grunt watch` process with `Ctrl+C` and run the following command in 
order to run the build tasks with special options for optimization and better
browser support.

```
$ grunt build
```

## What is a Component?

**Component**

_noun_

1. A reusable bundle of styles, markup, javascript, and other static resources 
compiled together with other components to make up a webpage. 

## Components of... Components
A component can consist of the following files:

* **SASS file** - Defines the visual styles of the component including any
modifiers as well as meta data about the component following the
[KSS](http://warpspire.com/kss/) syntax. See the example KSS comment below.
* **Handlebars template** - Defines the HTML structure and data fields that make
up the component.
* **JSON data** - Defines the schema for the data fields that fill the content
of the component and provides example data to populate the handlebars template.
* **Javascript file** - Defines any interactions required by the component.
* **Other static assets** - Any other assets such as images or SVGs to be used
in the generated icon font.

### Example Component Structure:

```
┌ components
└─┬ component-category
  └─┬ component-name 
    ├── _component-name.scss
    ├── component-name.hbs
    ├── component-name.json
    ├── component-name.js
    └─┬ component-assets
      ├── component-icon.svg
      └── component-image.png
```

### The SASS

We use a flavor of the [BEM](https://en.bem.info/) methodology when structuring
components. A component may contain the following parts:

* Component
* Element
* Modifier
* State

#### Class Name Structure
``` css
.the-component             # Component
.the-component__an-element # Sub-element
.the-component--modifier   # Modifier
.the-component:hover       # State
```

#### KSS Comments
We use KSS style comments in order to facilitate the automatic generation of the
style guide. Here is an example component declaration. This comment block should
live at the top of the SASS file for a component and be followed by the SASS 
code.

``` scss
/*
Component Name

Description of the component. This can use HTML or Github flavored markdown for
highlighting code snippets such as when mentioning a `.class-name`.

Markup: template-file.hbs

Weight: 1

.component--modifier - Description of this variation of the component
.component--modifier-two - Another description

Style guide: section.component
*/
```

##### Notes:

* The weight field is used for ordering the component within the generated style
guide. This affects both navigation as well as the order in which the component
shows up on the corresponding page. Weights are relative to the section in which
the component lives.
* There can be as many modifiers as needed and each one will will be displayed 
as a separate example in the style guide.
* The "Style guide" field determines the section and nesting in which the
component will be displayed in the generated style guide.
* To prevent the code example from rendering for a component, add a 
`Nocode: true` tag to the KSS comment.
* To prevent the the default example from rendering for a component, add a 
`Nodefault: true` tag to the KSS comment.
* To prevent the entire component from rendering in the style guide altogether, 
add a `Hidden: true` tag to the KSS comment. This is useful in cases where the 
component is not yet ready to be added to the style guide or when a handlebars 
template is needed as a partial, but doesn't correspond to an actual component.
* To alter the background color of an example, add a `Bgcolor: #333333` tag to 
the KSS comment where the value can be any CSS valid color (hexadecimal, rgb, or
color keyword). This is useful in the case that a component is meant to only be 
shown on a darker background, for instance.

### The Handlebars Template

Each component has a [handlebars template](http://handlebarsjs.com/) to define 
the HTML structure of the component. Templates will have the corresponding JSON
file as the context so all content and objects in the JSON is readily available
to the template. Additionally, all templates have a special `{{modifier_class}}`
placeholder available that KSS uses when creating each example of a component 
with all available modifiers. This placeholder should always be injected as a 
class on the component wrapper element.

#### Example:
``` handlebars
<div class="the-component {{modifier_class}}">
  {{#with name}}
    <h3 class="the-component__an-element">{{ name }}</h3>
  {{/with}}
  {{#with src}}
    <p>
      <img src="{{ src }}">
    </p>
  {{/with}}
  {{#if items}}
    <ul class="the-component__another-element">
      {{#each items}}
        <li>{{ label }}</li>
      {{/each}}
    </ul>
  {{/if}}
</div>
```

### The JSON

Each component has a JSON file that serves two purposes. First, it defines the 
data structure of the component which can be consumed by external systems to 
discover the structure of how to populate the template. Secondly, it also 
provides the style guide with example content to populate the rendered component
with. We're pretty fond of [placecage.com](http://www.placecage.com/) for 
placeholder images.

#### Example:
``` json
{
  "name": "Nicolas Cage",
  "src": "http://www.placecage.com/200/300",
  "items": [
    {
      "label": "Ghost Rider"
    },
    {
      "label": "Face/Off"
    },
    {
      "label": "National Treasure"
    }
  ]
}
```

### The Javascript

Some components may require javascript in order to implement interaction or 
other special functionality. Any `.js` files within a component will get 
concatenated into a single `scripts.js` file. 

### Other Assets

Some components might need other assets such as images or icons. These can also 
be included directly in the component folder or a sub-folder. 

#### Images

All jpg, png, and gif files get copied into the `build/` folder and are packaged
in the downloadable ZIP of assets. When referencing an image in component code, 
it must be referenced relative to `build/` using the following pattern:

```
/build/images/{component-section}/{component}/{optional sub-folder/}filename.png
```

#### Icons

Including a new icon to the icon font is just a matter of including a properly 
set up SVG file within your component. The build process will discover all SVG 
files and automatically compile them into the icon font and display them as in 
the style guide on the Icons component. SVG files should follow these 
guidelines:

Using Adobe Illustrator

* Artboard size: 512 x 512 px
  * Icon should be vertically and horizontally centered to the artboard
  * Icon should be scaled down as appropriate given the square size restriction
* **The SVG needs to be a single, filled shape object**
  * This means we can't just have groups of shapes, they need to be combined into one shape object via illustrator's pathfinder tool
  * The fill color should be #000000

[Example icon](components/blob/master/components/media/icons/svg/people.svg)

## Helpers

We have an handful of helper SCSS and JS that is made globally available within
all components as well as some helper JS plugins and CSS classes that could 
also be used outside of components on whatever system the component library is
being used on (they are included in the compiled CSS and aggregated JS files).

The code for all of these helpers lives  within several folders prefixed with
underscores within the `/components/` folder. 

### Base

Several very base-level styles live within [_base.scss](/components/_helpers/_base.scss).
These are very generic rules such as resets that need to happen globally on all 
pages.

### Colors

Colors are defined as SASS variables within [_colors.scss](/components/_colors/_colors.scss)
and can be used within any component. There are also several SASS maps available
that list off sets of colors for use when a component needs modifiers for each 
color within a set. An `@each` loop can be used within a component's SASS to
iterate over all of the colors in a map and automatically build each of the 
modifiers. 

#### Example
``` sass
// Create modifiers for each available text color.
@each $name, $color in $text-colors {
  .text--#{"" + $name} {
    color: $color;
  }
}
```

### Functions, Mixins, Variables

A handful of functions, mixins, and global variables live within 
[_helpers](/components/_helpers) in their respective folders and can be utilized
within any component. Have a peek to see what's available and add things that 
would be useful to have globally available. 

### Helper Classes & Placeholders

Lots of handy placeholders and helper classes are made available in the 
[_helpers.scss](/components/_helpers/_helpers.scss) and 
[_placeholders.scss](/components/_helpers/_placeholders.scss) files. Rather than 
listing them all out here, take a look in the folders to check out what's 
available for `@extend`'ing within components or including as classes within the
component markup. The helper classes can also prove very handy when building out
content on pages with static markup such as within a page in a CMS.

### Breakpoints

We use [breakpoint-sass](http://breakpoint-sass.com/) to handle media 
queries/breakpoints within components to support variations in components on
different screen sizes. We utilize the following breakpoints:

* **Mobile** - <940px
* **Tablet** - 640px - 960px
* **Desktop** - >960px

And we have the following SASS variables set so that we don't have to remember 
these ranges when we need to set up a breakpoint:

* `$mobile-max` or `$mobile-only` - _Will only trigger on the Mobile breakpoint_
* `$tablet-min` - _Will trigger on the Tablet and Desktop breakpoints_
* `$tablet-max` - _Will trigger on the Tablet and Mobile breakpoints_
* `$tablet-only` - _Will only trigger on the Tablet breakpoint_
* `$desktop-min` or `$desktop-only` - _Will only trigger on the Desktop breakpoint_

#### Example Usage
``` scss
.the-component {
  color: #f00;
  margin: 3em;

  // Reduce margin on Tablet and Mobile
  @include breakpoint($tablet-max) {
    margin: 2em;
  }

  // Change text color on Mobile
  @include breakpoint($mobile-only) {
    color: #0f0;
  }
}
```

#### Note:
SASS `@extend`s are not compatible media queries because of how `@extends` are
treated when compiled. This means you can't use `@extend` within a breakpoint.
If you are encountering issues styles not obeying a breakpoint you have set, 
this is likely the issue and you might need to rework your SASS to not include 
an `@extend`.

### JS Plugins/helpers
Several useful Javascript helpers are available in [helpers.js](/components/_helpers/helpers.js)
that can be utilized within any component-specific `.js` file. We also have 
custom plugins available in [_js_plugins](/components/_js_plugins) for generic 
functionality that needs to be available to multiple components. These plugins
are written as jQuery plugins. See [jQuery's documentation](https://learn.jquery.com/plugins/basic-plugin-creation/) for a guide on writing new plugins.


## Scaffold a component
We've built a tool to help scaffold out new components using [grunt-init](http://gruntjs.com/project-scaffolding)
See the [spawn-component](https://github.com/tableau-mkt/spawn-component) repo
to use this tool.

## Other info
* The style guide generator used in this project is [kss-node](https://github.com/kss-node/kss-node).
* The template used for kss-node is our custom-built [kss-template](https://github.com/tableau-mkt/kss-template).
