## Overview

Welcome to the the Tableau Style Guide! This style guide is a curated collection
of components used to build websites and pages with the Tableau corporate brand.
Explore the style guide with the navigation on the left to find working examples
of components as well as any variations (modifiers) and markup examples. 

Please note that this is a living style guide which automatically reflects
the latest updates and additions. Components will occasionally be updated, 
added, and possibly even removed.
